# About Me

Hi, I’m Sam – a 31-year-old mechanical engineer, entrepreneur, and maker based in Zurich.  
I studied at ETH Zurich, where I cultivated my passion for innovation and hands-on creation.

I’m currently working on making beautiful and smart solar facades with Solskin.  
My interests span technology, entrepreneurship, and crafting everything from my own furniture to everyday gadgets.
