<p>From the moment I saw the first concrete speaker, I was hooked on the idea. Ten years later, I finally made my own. Here’s the breakdown of why and how I made these unique speakers and what I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="the-inspiration"><strong>The Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve always loved the industrial, heavy-duty look in home settings—whether it’s an industrial loft, a motorbike in the living room, or power tools in the kitchen. Something about practicality and robustness always attracted me. While my interior design taste has evolved and softened over time, concrete remains a material that evokes strength and durability, a feeling I’ve been drawn to since my late teens.</p>

<p>It turns out concrete isn’t just aesthetically pleasing—it’s also a great material for making speaker enclosures. But there’s one catch: it’s not easy. Most hobbyist speaker builders opt for dense MDF because it’s easy to shape into a box of the desired volume, then add veneer or paint. I decided to take on the challenge of working with concrete because, well, why not?</p>

<p>Before diving into my specific design, let’s explore what a speaker enclosure actually does.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-does-a-speaker-enclosure-do"><strong>What Does a Speaker Enclosure Do?</strong></h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, a speaker enclosure isn’t like the body of a guitar that amplifies sound. Instead, it plays a more nuanced role. While a guitar body enhances its unique sound, a speaker enclosure needs to reproduce sound as accurately as possible—without adding its own “color.” This means minimizing resonances or interferences that could muddy the audio.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of a speaker enclosure is to isolate the rear sound waves emitted by the speaker driver from interfering with the front-facing waves. If these waves interact, they create constructive and destructive interference, degrading the listening experience. A sealed enclosure achieves this by isolating the rear waves and using the air inside as a spring to boost the driver’s effectiveness.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-enclosure"><strong>Choosing the Right Enclosure</strong></h2>
<p>There are three main types of speaker enclosures:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/speaker-types.png" alt="Speaker Types" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sealed Enclosures</strong>: Compact designs that isolate rear waves and use internal air pressure to enhance the sound.</li>
  <li><strong>Ported Enclosures</strong>: Designs with a tuned port or tube that extends the bass frequencies by using rear-displaced air.</li>
  <li><strong>Open Baffle Speakers</strong>: No enclosure at all, relying on the room itself to shape the sound.</li>
</ol>

<p>For my speakers, I chose a <strong>sealed enclosure</strong>. The compact design was essential since I wanted the speakers to fit on my desk without being overly large.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="designing-the-shape"><strong>Designing the Shape</strong></h2>
<p>Most midrange speakers have simple box-shaped enclosures because they’re easier to build. But boxes with parallel walls create internal standing waves, which can color the sound at specific frequencies. High-end speakers often use unique shapes to minimize these issues.</p>

<p>Since I was already casting my speaker enclosures, I decided to embrace non-traditional shapes. This led to an iterative design process where I prioritized <strong>draft angles</strong>—slight slopes that make objects easier to remove from molds. By embracing and magnifying these angles, I avoided problematic 90-degree edges and achieved a design that was both functional and visually striking.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-importance-of-the-baffle"><strong>The Importance of the Baffle</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>baffle</strong>, or the front face of the speaker, plays a critical role in sound quality. Two phenomena need to be considered:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Baffle Step</strong>: An increase in energy for frequencies above a certain point, causing louder midrange and treble. Proper baffle sizing mitigates this.</li>
  <li><strong>Diffraction</strong>: High frequencies scattering at sharp edges, causing interference. This can be reduced by rounding edges or using chamfers.</li>
</ol>

<p>For my design, I used chamfered edges and centered the tweeter horizontally for aesthetic reasons. I also ensured the distances from the tweeter to the edges were varied to minimize diffraction effects.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-concrete"><strong>Why Concrete?</strong></h2>
<p>Concrete is an excellent material for speaker enclosures because of its <strong>high damping capacity</strong> (2-5%). This means it’s less likely to resonate or “ring” like a bell, preserving the integrity of the sound. By using concrete, I created an enclosure that minimizes unwanted effects and produces cleaner audio.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-build-process"><strong>The Build Process</strong></h2>
<p>The journey of creating these speakers was as much about learning as it was about the final product. Designing a castable enclosure, understanding acoustic principles, and working with concrete all contributed to an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="stay-tuned"><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></h3>
<p>In my next post, I’ll dive deeper into the step-by-step process of building these speakers, from designing the molds to mixing and pouring the concrete. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed this look into the “why” and “what” behind my concrete fidelity project.</p>
